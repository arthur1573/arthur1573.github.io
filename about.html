<h2>
<br/>I remember when I was in elementary school.
<br/>
<br/>Slogans prohibiting burning wheat straws are posted everywhere,
<br/>
<br/>always seen during the wheat harvest season.
<br/>
<br/>I don't understand why it is forbidden.
<br/>
<br/>I didn't understand a little until one afternoon:
<br/>
<br/>That afternoon the school suddenly notified that there would be no classes in the afternoon.
<br/>
<br/>This kind of unprecedented thing is only possible if the school's electric room blows up.
<br/>
<br/>So after lunch, I go out for a walk.
<br/>
<br/>Unexpectedly, the sky turned dark.
<br/>
<br/>I take out my watch to check the time.
<br/>
<br/>Make sure it's two o'clock in the afternoon.
<br/>
<br/>then everything around is dyed gold.
<br/>
<br/>Gradually turns orange, then turns to dark yellow.
<br/>
<br/>Soon yellow to the end, only black remains.
<br/>
<br/>In dark midnight has moonlight,
<br/>
<br/>I was walking on the road but I couldn't see my fingers.
<br/>
<br/>That's the darkest black I've ever seen.
<br/>
<br/>After about 40 minutes,
<br/>
<br/>The sky only leaked the color of burning clouds.
<br/>
<br/>It turns out that darkness does not only exist in the most hidden corners.
<br/>
<br/>This place I lived in is full of dark, so I want to run.
<br/>
