<br/>
<br/>Who I am
<br/>Hi there, I'm Yatao
<br/>or Hi, you can call me Arthur
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Where am I from
<br/>I'm from China. I was born and raised in China.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Where I live right now 
<br/>Right now, I live in Henan.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>How I feel about the city
<br/>I do not like living in Henan. 
<!-- <br/>I think it's a dark province, and full of expensive ice-cream.  -->
<br/>The food is spicy. There are a few hamburger stores nearby. 
<!-- <br/>People are poor to understand the world, so they always say:  A temper to be bear much, will have much to win.
<br/>I've been living here for twenty years, I 've watched the children walking my step one year by one year.
<br/> -->
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>What I do for a living
<br/>I work as a content uploader for part-time.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>How I feel about my job
<br/>I love being a uploader but it is hard for a living. So I try to learn something else, like helpdesk, for a better money to buy burgers.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>A little more about myself 
<br/>I have a lot of hobbies and interests. I like playing ping pang with old gentleman. They are really good at to rotate the ball. I want to become those men when I am old enough. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/><!-- 
<br/>One more thing, how I feel about the world:
<br/>
<br/>I remember when I was in elementary school.
<br/>
<br/>Slogans prohibiting burning wheat straws are posted everywhere,
<br/>
<br/>always seen during the wheat harvest season.
<br/>
<br/>I don't understand why it is forbidden.
<br/>
<br/>I didn't understand a little until one afternoon:
<br/>
<br/>That afternoon the school suddenly notified that there would be no classes in the afternoon.
<br/>
<br/>This kind of unprecedented thing is only possible if the school's electric room blows up.
<br/>
<br/>So after lunch, I go out for a walk.
<br/>
<br/>Unexpectedly, the sky turned dark.
<br/>
<br/>I take out my watch to check the time.
<br/>
<br/>Make sure it's two o'clock in the afternoon.
<br/>
<br/>then everything around is dyed gold.
<br/>
<br/>Gradually turns orange, then turns to dark yellow.
<br/>
<br/>Soon yellow to the end, only black remains.
<br/>
<br/>In dark midnight has moonlight,
<br/>
<br/>I was walking on the road but I couldn't see my fingers.
<br/>
<br/>That's the darkest black I've ever seen.
<br/>
<br/>After about 40 minutes,
<br/>
<br/>The sky only leaked the color of burning clouds.
<br/>
<br/>It turns out that darkness does not only exist in the most hidden corners.
<br/>
<br/>This place I lived in is full of dark, so I want to run. -->
