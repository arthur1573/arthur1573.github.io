<h1>The Children of the New Forest</h1></br></br>
<h2>Frederick Marryat</h2>
<h2>Rowena Akinyemi</h2></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>THE CHILDREN OF THE NEW FOREST</br></br>It is 1647 and the four Beverley children — Edward, Humphrey, Alice and little Edith — are in hiding in the New Forest.</br>The King of England is in prison, and there is fighting everywhere in the country — Cromwell's men against the King's</br>men. And if you are a friend of the King, you are in great danger…</br></br></br></br>The children's father died while fighting for the King, their mother is dead, Cromwell's soldiers have burnt their home,</br>and they have no money, no food, nothing. But they have one true friend — old Jacob Armitage. So now, with Jacob to help</br>them, they must learn to live off the land — to hunt for meat in the forest, to plant vegetables, to look after the pigs</br>and chickens…</br></br></br></br>But Cromwell's men are everywhere, and the children must learn never to say that their name is Beverley...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>Chapter 1</br></br>Escape!</br></br></br></br>'Burn Arnwood! They can't do that! It's my house, and I'm staying here!' Edward said angrily. He was fourteen years old,</br>the oldest of the four Beverley children.</br></br>// It is a brave boy because he want to protect the house</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>Before he left home, he asked Jacob, a poor forester who lived near Arnwood, to look after his family. Jacob knew the</br>family well and was happy to do this.</br></br>// This is why you should be nice with neighborhood</br></br>// The remote water cannot solve the close thirsty</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>'My dear boy,' Jacob said, 'remember your sisters and brother. The soldiers will shoot them, or burn them in the house.</br>No, no, you must all come with me.'</br></br>// The Forester realized he need to help all of them</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>Jacob told Alice, who was eleven, and Edith, who was eight, that they were going to visit his home in the forest. He did</br>not tell them about the soldiers.</br></br>// It is hard to explain why on earth someone wants to kill them</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>After a while he heard horses, and the Parliamentary soldiers arrived. Soon they were in the gardens and all round the</br>house.</br></br>// The children leave the house on time</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>Edward slowly followed Jacob into the cottage. He hated Cromwell and the Parliamentary soldiers. First they killed his</br>father, and now they burnt his house. He lay down on the bed, but he did not sleep.</br></br>// The soldiers just obey the order without feeling, the key point is finding the person who behind the fire</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>'My dinner for a week,' explained Jacob. 'I can't light a fire every day, so I cook once a week.'</br></br>// Under the word: I am so poor, please do not take it away</br></br>// The soldiers absolutely understand and took away</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>But you are still in danger, and so you must stay here with me and pretend to be my grandchildren. You are children of</br>the New Forest now.'</br></br>// The children have to play a new game now</br></br>// It is not big deal because they have a good friend Jacob, is not?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>Chapter 2</br></br>Life in the Forest</br></br></br></br>'Only a little noise will frighten a red deer,' said Jacob kindly. 'But these mistakes can happen to anyone, and you</br>will learn. Now — not a word, and not a sound!'</br></br>// not a anger</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>It was a good beginning to their new life, and the next day Jacob rode to Lymington to sell some of the meat. With the</br>money he bought things for the vegetable garden, a big bag of oatmeal for the winter, and a gun for Edward.</br></br>// Beginning to their new life in the Forest is good</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>Alice learned…Edith learned…Humphrey was clever with his hands…Edward learned…</br></br>They were all busy and happy…</br></br>// Everybody learned how to do for living</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>'I've found a cow! She's left the other cows because of her new-born calf. So she's alone, and we can catch her.'</br></br>// Because a cow group has a leader cow, without the leader order a female cow cannot have a new-born calf.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>Every day for a fortnight Humphrey brought grass to the cow, and every day she was a little quieter. After a month,</br>Humphrey began to take milk from the cow.</br></br>// fortnight: two weeks. Humphrey take care of the cow and calf, so the cow take back for milk.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>'I have learned how to shoot deer,' said Edward. 'But Humphrey has caught a cow and given us milk. You are cleverer than</br>I am, brother!'</br></br>// Edward was brave, Humphrey was clever.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>Chapter 3</br></br>Edward Goes Visiting</br></br>A girl aged about fourteen opened the door, and told him that Oswald Partridge was out in the forest.</br></br>…</br></br>'Wait a minute,' the girl said. She went inside, and then came back. 'You must come and speak to my father.'</br></br>// Oswald Partridge was NOT out in the forest</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>Edward felt angry. But he was just a poor, unimportant forester, he remembered. So he said nothing, and waited.</br></br>// He remembered he was poor child for now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>'Why must he see you, sir?'</br></br>'My grandfather has not heard this, sir,' said Edward.</br></br>'When I was a child, I lived at Arnwood with the Beverley children.'</br></br>// A forester child is not able to speak like this.</br></br>// Hetherstone also can see it at once.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>'Because Cromwell has given the New Forest to me, to look after for Parliament. My name is Hetherstone, and all the</br>foresters now work for me.'</br></br>// Maybe Hetherstone is Parliament's son.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>'Sir,' Edward said quietly, 'the King himself is in prison and so he cannot pay his foresters. If they kill the deer, it</br>is because they must have food to eat. I am sure the King will understand that his people must live.'</br></br>// Edward bravely speaks to the Hetherstone, very brave, all of child of forest can not speak like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>Oswald was very surprised to see him. 'I never knew Jacob had a grandson,' he said. 'I never knew he had a son! Are you</br>on the King's side, like Jacob?'</br></br>'To the death, ' replied Edward</br></br>// But Oswald knew what is matter: Edward is on the King's side</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>'But Mr Hetherstone will want to thank you for saving his daughter's life,' said Oswald.</br></br>'I don't want Mr Hetherstone's thanks. I want nothing from the King's enemy,' said Edward.</br></br>// Edward was just trying to save everybody in the flames for nothing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>Chapter 4</br></br>Secretary to Mr Hetherstone</br></br></br></br>In the evening Jacob spoke to them all very lovingly, one by one. Those were his last words, and a little later, he</br>died.</br></br>// Every child has last words and different destiny.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>King Charles... He never listened to Parliament, he did only what he wanted, and the people were very angry.</br></br>// Charles did only what he wanted, and never heard other person's advice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>But for now we can't speak of these things openly — it's too dangerous.</br></br>// Some clever people do not speak ALL things they have known.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>I know that you want to get out into the world, but for now you must take this job.</br></br>// This is not good and that is not good so what is good for NOW.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>Then, with his father's sword by his side, Edward rode away on Mr Hetherstone's black horse, to fight for the King at</br>last.</br></br>// It is time to fight for the King, for the family.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>Chapter 5</br></br>Soldier of the King</br></br></br></br>It was clever of you to come back in a Roundhead's uniform — that will help to keep both of us out of danger.'</br></br>// New mission: as a spy waiting for time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>'Patience is rich now,' he thought, 'and many men will want to marry her. And I don't think that she loves me. And if I</br>say I am Edward Beverley, I'm sure that Parliament will take Arnwood back, and I'll still be a poor forester. </br></br>// This is why some people call somebody clever.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>'All my plans have gone wrong,' Mr Hetherstone told.</br></br>She loves him, but she wanted to talk to me first, because she thought that Edward was a poor man.And I asked Parliament</br>for Arnwood because I wanted to rebuild the house and then give it to Edward.</br></br>// Everybody knows there is a elephant in the room except the elephant.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>Edward was away for nearly nine years, fighting with the French army in France and Holland and Spain.</br></br>// NINE years become a MAN.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>@Oxford booklibray</br>    </br></body></br></html>
