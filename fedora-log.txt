windows10 could connect a .ovpn file, 
but fedora38 cannot connect to the server 




check system log, every system has every log file
https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/viewing-logs/



check log file
for Fedora 38
journalctl | grep openvpn | tail -n 30




so, bing.com search this:
AUTH_FAILED,Data channel cipher negotiation failed (no shared cipher)

I am having an issue with my .ovpn credentials, for some reason when I tried connecting this morning using my credentials I am getting the error:
"2022-06-29 08:40:44 AUTH: Received control message: AUTH_FAILED,Data channel cipher negotiation failed (no shared cipher)
"
Is anyone else having this issue, or know of a fix?    



rdre8:
Edit your downloaded ovpn file, replace ‘cipher AES-128-CBC’with ‘data-ciphers-fallback AES-128-CBC’






i do not know what is it really mean, just change the ciper code
it has done
it is amazing, does not?
