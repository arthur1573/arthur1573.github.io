when you want to open firewall, how to setup a share folder

normal people will close firewall, because it will cost a lot of time to learn

if you are a IT support or IT helpdesk, things get difference




cmd: firewall.cpl
    advanced setting
    inbound rule
        file and printer share(smb-in)
            scope(effect what domains)
                remote ip address
                any ip address âˆš











i recently found that an operation system is bound with hardware,


for example, my cpu is intel i5-7100, my mother board is Dell OptiPlex 3050,

when i update my system to windows11, i cannot find the internet information services(IIS) in control panel

(certainly opend it in windows function)

when get back to windows10, then i can open IIS, setup a ftp

if firewall is open, it has to setup again in firewall.cpl

add FTP server to bypass firewall











if you open firewall, there are a lot work waiting for you,

for instance, when finished installing a software, the new software always jumps a window, 

system ask you want to this new guy bypass firewall?

if system do not ask you, you must add it in firewall

for example, download a software: myftp.exe to desktop

setup is done, but cannot use

most reason is that: firewall is open, firewall do not permit myftp.exe to connect with others

you need to setup firewall: permit other application pass firewall's block


control panel
    system and security
        windows defender firewall
            permit application pass firewall
            permit other application
                path browse
                select myftp.exe
                add
        confirm
    done
