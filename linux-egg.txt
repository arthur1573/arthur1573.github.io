# If you have already installed the latest version of fortune-mod 
# but are still unable to use the fortune command, there may be a few possible reasons:

# PATH issue: The system may not be able to find the fortune command. 
# You can try adding the directory containing the fortune command 
# to the PATH environment variable. For example, 
# if the fortune command is located in /usr/games, 
# you can add the following line to your configuration file (such as ~/.bashrc):

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/games
